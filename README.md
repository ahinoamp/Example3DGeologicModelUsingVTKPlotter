# Example of plotting 3D Geologic Model Using VTKPlotter

This binder notebook provides an example of using VTKPlotter to create a 3D geologic model that you can then embed in a website.

The main notebook creates a model of a real geothermal reservoir in Utah that is part of a project called FORGE (Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy).

All of the data is from the publicly available Geothermal Data Repository (https://gdr.openei.org/home) uploaded by the Energy and Geoscience Institute at the University of Utah.
